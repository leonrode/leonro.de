            I have been on the programming journey for over seven years,
            building projects in multiple domains. I enjoy building beautiful
            websites, but also exploring low-level programming topics as well.{" "}
            <br />
            Besides websites, I have developed Arduino drivers, procedural art,
            and more.

            <br />I applied my skills to Freelancing, where I developed Python
            utilities and websites for multiple clients. <br />
            During the seven months I worked, I completed over eight orders,
            reached close to two-thousand customers, and finished with a perfect
            five-star rating.

            <br />
            Aside from developing software, I enjoy playing piano, playing
            games, and hanging out with friends.
